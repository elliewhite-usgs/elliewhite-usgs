Hello 

I'm Ellie White (she/her) currently a data scientist with the Data Science Branch at US Geological Survey. In my role, I spend about 3/4 of my time working on data science projects and the other 1/4 on improving our data science best practices.

Examples of my USGS work available on GitHub include:
* 🌊 beyond-a-reasonable drought: Data visualization I made for #chartchallenge23, and the chart is meant to communicate the difference in the length of droughts in the Common Era. The hardest part was setting up the pipeline that processes the data. https://github.com/whiteellie/beyond-a-reasonable-drought
* 🐟 fish-in-hot-water: Data visualization I made for #chartchallenge23, and the chart is meant to communicate the effects of climate change on fish spawning.	https://github.com/whiteellie/fish-in-hot-water 
* 👌 quality-assurance: [in progress] Quality assurance plans for predictive modeling and data visualizations that list best practices and the branch's cultural norms. https://github.com/whiteellie/quality-assurance

Examples of my USGS work available on GitLab include++:
* 🌍 national-geospatial-attributes: [in progress] Lead developer of an R and targets geospatial processing pipeline that takes attributes processed to one spatial scale and transforms them to another scale based on downstream modeling requirements. This single pipeline will be used to develop and QC model inputs for three active projects in the Water Mission area and will be able to accommodate future modeling projects as needs arise – driving down development time and labor costs. https://code.usgs.gov/wma/wp/national-geospatial-attributes
* ✅ model-eval: [in progress] Lead developer of a model evaluation pipeline that implements drought pooling and matching for evaluation of observations against predictions. The pipeline evaluates how well a given ML model predicts streamflow droughts across several metrics important to decision makers including drought occurrence, onset, recovery, severity, and duration. https://code.usgs.gov/water/RegionalDroughtEarlyWarning/modeling/model-eval

Examples of my work under previous affiliations:
* 🎓 geostatistics-tutorial: Took concepts and computations done manually in a geostatistics course in the Department of Hydrology at UC Davis and translated it to R. Other students have used this to guide their studies and graduate research. https://github.com/whiteellie/geostatistics-tutorial 
* 👑 us-presidents: Made a classroom style poster of all U.S. presidents calling out some notable events in history. https://github.com/whiteellie/us-presidents
